# Unity Branch Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
- Unity installed on your system (make sure its the Student Plan Version)
- Editor Version: 2022.3.35f1

## Getting Started

1. Pull the latest changes from the repository.

2. Open Unity Hub.

3. Click "Add project" (NOT "New project").

4. Select the "Brainforge Unity Game" folder as the project directory.
   - **Important:** Do not select the "unity-game-implementation" folder, as Unity won't detect the necessary files.

5. If prompted, choose the "2D Universal" environment.

## Exploring the Project

To begin working on the game:

1. Navigate to `Assets -> 2D RPG KIT -> Scenes -> Demo`.
2. Choose a map section to start with. (Our map starts with island 1)

**Note:** There are two "Scene" folders. Use the one from the 2D RPG KIT asset, not the vanilla Unity folder.

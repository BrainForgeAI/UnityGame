  - We may not have gold or jewels, but we have resourceful people, 
  - untapped natural resources, and a strategic location.
  - With your support, we could become a valuable trading post and ally.
  - //Merchant King
  - '**'
  - Interesting... But I don't make deals on mere promises.
  - Prove your island's worth, and perhaps we can come to an arrangement.

  - There's a dangerous bandit causing havoc at the end of the mud trail south of my mansion.
  - They've been intercepting my shipments and disrupting trade. 
  - Deal with this menace, and I'll consider your proposal for an alliance.
  - Fail, and you'll wish you'd never set foot on my golden shores. Do we have a deal?
  - //Rem
  - '**'
  - (taking a deep breath)
  - ... Ehm...
  - I understand. I accept your challenge, Your Majesty. 
  - I'll deal with this bandit and prove my worth.

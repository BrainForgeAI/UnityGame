  - I just wanted to ask you the same thing.
  - How did you even get in here?
  - Even if you were able to cross the river in the forest, it is impossible for
    you
  - to enter through the locked gate.
  - //Moz
  - '**2'
  - So you were the jester who fished the logs out of the water while I took a nap?!
  - //Hollis
  - '**1'
  - Impossible to enter through the gate?
  - All it took was to flip three switches.
  - That's what I would call bad security.
  - //Rem
  - '**0'
  - ... Ehm...
  - Hello strange, bearded thing...
  - Whatever goes on here, we are only here for a magic truffle.
  - //Strange Figure
  - '**'
  - Well, I don't think you have a shot there kiddo.
  - 'These magic truffles are all mine and I will use them to '
  - conjure up the best meat dishes.
  - and then I'll scarf them down all by myself!
  - //Moz
  - '**2'
  - So, you won't give us any of your magic truffles?
  - That sounds like you're asking for a beating.
  - //Strange Figure
  - '**'
  - Well, I guess we gonna have ourselves an obligatory boss fight then

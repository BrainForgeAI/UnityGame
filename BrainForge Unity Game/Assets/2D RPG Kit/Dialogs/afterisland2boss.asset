  - Thank Y-
  - //Island Boss
  - '**'
  - I'm not done talking.
  - I'll provide some resources for your island.
  - "But listen closely \u2013 if you want real wealth and power, you should seek
    out the Golden Isle."
  - //Rem
  - '**'
  - The Golden Isle? I've never heard of it.
  - //Island Boss
  - '**'
  - Few have. It's the wealthiest island in these waters, ruled by the Merchant King.
  - If anyone can truly help your people, it's him.
  - "But be warned \u2013 he's as cunning as he is rich."
  - //Rem
  - '**'
  - Thank you for the information and the help. How can I find this Golden Isle?
  - //Island Boss
  - '**'
  - Follow the mud trail directly south of the island where you will board your boat,
  - I will ask my butlers to transport your boat.
  - From there take the boat northeast, past the Siren's Rocks.
  - But remember, wealth often comes with a price.

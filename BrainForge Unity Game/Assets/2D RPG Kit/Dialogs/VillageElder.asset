  - "Ah, I've been expecting you, young one. I can see the worry in your eyes \u2013"
  - The same worry that plagues us all.

  - Elder, I can't ignore it anymore. Our village is struggling. There must be something
    we can do.
  - //Village Elder
  - '**'
  - Indeed, our island has fallen on hard times. Our resources dwindle, and our people
    suffer.
  - We need someone brave enough to venture beyond our shores,
  - to seek help and new opportunities. Are you willing to take on this crucial task?
  - //Rem
  - '**'
  - I... I've never left the island before. But if our people need help, I'll do
    whatever it takes!!
  - //Village Elder
  - '**'
  - Your courage gives me hope. But be warned, the journey won't be easy.
  - You'll need to prove yourself worthy even to leave our shores.
  - Head to the island dock where you will face your first challenge.

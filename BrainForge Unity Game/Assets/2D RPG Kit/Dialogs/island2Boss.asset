  - So, you're the one causing all this commotion. What do you want?
  - //Rem
  - '**'
  - Sir, I come from a struggling island.
  - Our resources are depleting, and our people are suffering. We need help.
  - //Island Boss
  - '**'
  - And why should I care about your problems? We have our own issues to deal with.
  - //Rem
  - '**'
  - Because helping us could benefit you too. We have skilled craftsmen and fertile
    land.
  - With some support, we could become valuable trading partners.
  - //Island Boss
  - '**'
  - Hmm... You make an interesting point. But words are cheap.
  - Prove your worth in combat by stepping towards my house, and I might consider your proposal.

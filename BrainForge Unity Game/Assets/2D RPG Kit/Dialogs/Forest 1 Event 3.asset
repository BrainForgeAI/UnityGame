  - //Moz
  - '**2'
  - I don't know...
  - Just wanted to catch some z's under the tree.
  - When I woke up, some jester had already pulled all the logs out of the water.
  - I could have just swimmed over but I didn't want my clobber to get wet.
  - //Hollis
  - '**1'
  - Good thing we just came here on our way to the cave.
  - //Moz
  - '**2'
  - Very true kid!
  - Anyway, what can two tots like you look for in that creepy cave?
  - //Rem
  - '**0'
  - We need the magic truffles that grow there for my mother's recipe.
  - //Moz
  - '**2'
  - Magic truffels, huh?
  - I heard the magic truffle has a fantastic taste that is ideal for meat dishes.
  - Alright! You helped me out so I will help you in your search!
